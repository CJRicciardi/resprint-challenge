##### What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

When it comes to code reviews, there are two things that I look for.  First, is it readable (pep8) if it's in pep8 format, it is usually quite readable, if it's not it makes things much more difficult.  More importantly, I want to make sure I understand what the code is doing.  As they say, debuging is twice as hard as coding, therefore your code needs to be very simple in order for you to debug it.

##### We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?

Using containers would allow the end users to load the necessary container when they are working on a program.  What that does is create the required enviroment on the machine when they are running the program that requires said container.  In plain english, containers replicate having a bunch of identical machines with out having a bunch of identical machines.
